# Advent of Code 2020

I just started this repo with my solutions for each of the programming puzzles of this year's calendar. I started the repo a little late, so I will be adding my solutions from day_1 to day_8 (which I have already solved) in the next few days.

Today, I begin with day_9 solutions.
